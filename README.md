AI System Preflight

Most AI/agent systems fail because design flaws are discovered after implementation.

This project encodes a structured pre-build methodology that forces system clarity before code is written. It is the method I use with AI to collapse the time between idea and correct implementation.

#Example
“Build an LLM agent that summarizes legal documents and answers questions.”
